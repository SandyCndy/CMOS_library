## 🧱 CMOS NOR Gate Design

### ➤ Logic Function
The NOR gate performs the logical operation:

```

Y = NOT (A + B)

````

### ➤ Schematic Design Description

- **NMOS Transistors**: Two NMOS transistors connected in parallel between output and ground.
- **PMOS Transistors**: Two PMOS transistors connected in series between VDD and output.

## 📐 Layout Design

* The layout is designed using 200nm technology design rules.
* Both NMOS and PMOS transistors are sized for optimal switching and drive strength.
* DRC and LVS checks are passed to ensure design validity.

## ✅ Simulation Results

* The NOR logic behavior is validated through transient analysis.
* Output waveform `Y` shows expected LOW output when either `A` or `B` is HIGH.
* Logic high is observed only when both inputs are LOW.

## 📁 Technology Models![411302506-fcb25018-cdd5-40b4-bea3-d7ba91bfc702](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00a2e085-c561-4e90-b095-046d2937369a)

Device modeling is based on C5 200nm technology:

* **NMOS** and **PMOS** models include accurate parameters such as:

  * Threshold voltage (VTH0)
  * Mobility (U0)
  * Short channel effects (DIBL, velocity saturation)
  * Capacitances (Cj, Cjsw, CGSO, CGDO)

Models used are BSIM3 Level 7.

## 📌 Tools Used

* Layout Tool: \[Specify tool e.g., Cadence Virtuoso / Microwind / Magic]
* SPICE Simulator: \[e.g., LTspice, HSPICE, Ngspice]
* Technology Node: 200nm (C5 CMOS)
